## Litter Box Loot

<b style="font-size: 20px;"><i>E-commerce for cats!</i></b>

### Application Overview

Litter Box Loot is my front end capstone that acts as an e-commerce app for cats to display and sell products.

I built this application in two weeks initially, using React Hooks and CSS for styling. My goals were to incorporate full CRUD functionality, gain a deeper understanding of React Hooks, props, and state, while also incorporating an intuitive, functional user interface, without the use of bootstrapped components.

This application uses mock authentication which is purely for demonstration purposes. Therefore the login and registration code written here is completely insecure and would never be implemented in a professional application.

1. Clone this repository and change to the directory in the terminal.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:JulieAF/litter-box-loot.git
cd litter-box-loot
